# An Angular 2.0 todo list application


 + Angular 2.0 event and property binding
 + Two-way binding
 + Dependency Injection
 + How to create components with properties and events
 + Component view encapsulation and change detection strategies
 + A flux-like approach with a store for persisting data


## Getting Started

 - Clone or download the repo
 - Run `npm install`
 - Run `gulp serve`

This will start a development server and launch your browser to show the application in action. For development I've been using the Atom editor with the **atom-typescript** plugin and **linter-tslint**.
